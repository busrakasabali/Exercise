    "The data sets for this task and the demo predictions file 'Demo_Predictions.csv' can be found on the main Moodle page under 'Task 1 Data'. The format of your predictions should be the same as the csv demo file. Also, your predictions should be in the original scale of the train and test datasets. The files 'train_X.csv' and 'test_X.csv' contain the predictors in the train and test set, respectively. The file 'train_y.csv' contains the target variable in the train set. In the second section of this notebook we demonstrate how to import the data.\n",

    "- Preprocessing of your datasets according to the requirements of neural networks. (different features have different descriptive statistics!)\n",
    "- Implementation of 3 benchmark models: a linear model, a tree-based model and a neural network that has not been tuned. \n",
    "- Tuning of a neural network using a hyperparameter optimization library of your choice. The code for hyperparameter tuning should include regularization. \n",
    "- A well annotated plot showing the train vs. validation loss of the best performing neural network. Based on the plot you should interpret the model fit with max. 2 sentences. Anything beyond these 2 sentences will not participate in the evaluation!\n",
    "- Additionally, you should provide an interpretation of why you believe the best performing architecture is suitable for your task in max. 3 sentences.\n",

    "- Well documented code, which is divided into functions, classes, etc.\n",
