        "You are already familiar with building predictive models on tabular data. With the latter, you have a feature matrix `X` and a target vector `Y`. Given these data structures, you can apply ML algorithms to learn the relationship between `X` and `Y`. In this notebook, you will work with a dataset consisting of movie reviews, each labeled with either a negative or positive sentiment. In contrast to numerical tabular data, textual data cannot be fed directly into ML algorithms for predictive modeling purposes. Thus, with textual data, you need to preprocess each data sample to obtain the required feature matrix `X`. This processing of the data is what we call the \"NLP pipeline\". The dimensionality and the quality of the features, which can be extracted from textual data, depend on the preprocessing steps implemented in the NLP pipeline. In this notebook, we will mainly focus on NLP preprocessing and frequency-based feature creation.<br>\n",

In combination with \"http\", we essentially look for a substring in our textual sample that starts with \"http\" and is followed by one or more non-whitespace characters. Put in other words, the pattern will find everything from \"http\" until the next space, and remove the corresponding content.

When we feed text with any HMTL content to `BeautifulSoup` we use the function `get_text()` to retrieve the HTML tag-free version of our textual sample.

While stemming is a crude heuristic to remove the end or the beginning of a word based on pre-defined suffixes and prefixes, respectively, lemmatization normalizes tokens by reducing words to their dictionary form. Since stemming can produce non-existent words, lemmatization is the better choice for ensuring consistency in how we represent text. Determining the grammatical role, i.e., a token's part-of-speech tag, can improve the results obtained with lemmatization.

Both classes are available in the `sklearn` library. Similar to data preprocessing in tabular datasets, you will call the function `fit_transform()` to extract frequency features on the training set, whereas you will apply the function `transform()` to your test set. Also, since you have already applied your custom preprocessing function to the moview reviews dataset, you can pass a dummy function as an argument to the input parameters  `tokenizer` and `preprocessor` of `TfidfVectorizer` and `CountVectorizer`. In this way, the vectorizers would not clean the data, but would only extract frequency-based features.\n",
